                <h2 class="h-secondary center">MERU CABS</h2>
                <p class="center">Meru Cabs is an Indian ridesharing company based in India. Founded by Neeraj Gupta in 2006, the company is headquartered in Mumbai. Meru revolutionized the way people travelled in cabs by offering AC cabs at their doorstep with a single call. This goes way back in time when the black and yellow taxis (Kaali-peeli taxis) largely dominated Mumbai city roads. Meru is also accredited to be one of the first Indian companies to introduce electric vehicles in its fleet.
